# Intro to Module 2: Using Git Locally

We'll start by learning some handy shortcuts and looking into how we can get more info out of our version control system. Then we'll experience the true power of Git by seeing how
we can undo some of our changes. The ability to revert previous changes is one of the most useful aspects of version control systems. Depending on what needs to be undone, there's 
a bunch of different techniques that we can use in Git. We can discard the changes made to a file, fix a commit that was incorrect and even roll back our project to an older 
snapshot. We'll look into all these techniques and dive into when to use each of them. Finally, we'll check out yet another important concept, Branches. We can use branches to 
work on an experimental feature without affecting the main code of our project. Support separate versions of a program that can't be merged together and much more. We'll dive 
into what branches are, when and how to use them and how to deal with merge conflicts.

# Skipping the Staging Area
When we covered the basic Git workflow, we called out that the process is usually to make changes, stage them, and then commit them. The separate step between staging and 
committing allows us to stage several changes in one commit.
