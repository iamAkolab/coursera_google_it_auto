## Data Types

# In Python, text in between quotes -- either single or double quotes -- is a string data type. 
# An integer is a whole number, without a fraction, while a float is a real number that can contain a fractional part. 
# For example, 1, 7, 342 are all integers, while 5.3, 3.14159 and 6.0 are all floats. 
# When attempting to mix incompatible data types, you may encounter a TypeError.

# type() -  is used to know what type of data you are handling in python

print(type(input()))
# prints the data type of the input

# Variables are names that we give to certain values in our programs. 
# Those values can be of any data type; numbers, strings or even the results of operations.
