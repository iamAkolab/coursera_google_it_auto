# Intro to Module 3: Working with Remotes

 In this module, we'll learn a load of new things related to GitHub and remote repositories. We'll first talk about what GitHub is and why it matters, and 
 then we'll dive into how to work with GitHub and other remote repositories. Being able to use remote repositories allows us to effectively collaborate with others. 
 
 Our collaborators can be sitting in the same office as we are or they can be thousands of miles away on a different continent working at a different time of day. 
 Using a version control system like Git lets us incorporate the work of different people no matter where they are or when they're working. 
 
 I've personally had a bunch of interesting experiences collaborating through a version control system. One that stands out was a debugging session a friend and 
 I had while at work. I was working on some tricky code and I couldn't figure out the best way to implement a function. I was stuck and ready to give up completely. 
 My colleague suggested that I work on another piece of the file further down while he figured out the optimal solution for the code that I was having trouble with. 
 This was a super seamless experience and was only possible because of a VCS, and the superpower of teamwork of course. 
 
 By the end of the module you'll be able to collaborate with friends and colleagues just like I did
